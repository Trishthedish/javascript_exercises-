## JavaScript Exercises 1 - 2

# Switching from Ruby to JavaScript
## Trish Griego's Takeaways from this assignment:
 1. ``` puts``` equivalent is ```console.log()```
 2. When trying to figure out what's happening in function in Ruby you might use a simple puts or print statement. In JavaScript you will use: console.log("typically needs concatenation to be useful" + function(call))
 3. ```ToDo.setDone(); // complete task.
ToDo.getDone(); // view the done attribute.``` ```getDone()``` is simply the ```ðŸ‘€``` eyes into whats happening in the function/aka method. Which means the two expressions are both needed to setDone to true && then to view what is now stored in done.

4. Appears you might be able to run multiple methods with same name in console without expected errors.
