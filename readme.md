## JavaScript Exercises 1 - 2

# Switching from Ruby to JavaScript
## Trish Griego's Takeaways from this assignment:
 1. ``` puts``` equivalent is ```console.log()```

 2. When trying to figure out what's happening in function in Ruby you might use a simple puts or print statement. In JavaScript you will use: console.log("typically needs concatenation to be useful" + function(call))

 3. ```ToDo.setDone(); // complete task.
ToDo.getDone(); // view the done attribute.``` ```getDone()``` is simply the ```ðŸ‘€``` eyes into whats happening in the function. Which means the two expressions are both needed to setDone to true & then to view what is now stored in done attribute.

4. ```node javascript_ex_2.js``` equivalent to ``` ruby fake_ruby_ex_to_be_run_in_terminal.rb```

5. In **"javascript_ex2.js"** Created two potential solutions and found that my terminal didn't throw an error when I attempted to run them both at same time.
