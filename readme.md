## Takeaways from this assignment:
 1. ``` puts``` equivalent is ```console.log()```
 2. When trying to figure out what's happening in function in Ruby you might use a simple puts or print statement. In JavaScript you will use: console.log("typically needs concatenation to be useful" + function(call))
 3. ```ToDo.setDone(); // complete task.
ToDo.getDone(); // view the done attribute. ```. getDone() is simply the ðŸ‘€ eyes for us. Which means the two expressions are both needed to setDone to true && then to view what is now in it.


# EXERCISES:

### Exercise #1: Create a ToDo object, with the following properties:

- a task (a string) - a description of the thing to do
- assignee (a string) - the name of a person to do it
